# 🛠️ Tools Module – Overview

The **Tools module** in SpaceLinx MES is designed to manage all equipment, instruments, and devices that are essential for manufacturing operations. Every tool used in production needs to be properly recorded, categorized, and tracked to ensure accuracy, availability, and compliance.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Centralized Tool Management**  
  Provides a single source of truth for all tool-related information, eliminating scattered spreadsheets or isolated records.

- **Traceability & Compliance**  
  Ensures every tool’s usage, updates, and current status can be traced for audits and quality checks.

- **Operational Efficiency**  
  Streamlines access so operators and engineers can quickly locate and verify tools.

## 🔑 Core Concepts

- **Tool Number** → Unique identifier that prevents duplicates and ensures traceability.
- **Tool Name** → A descriptive label that helps users recognize the tool in day-to-day work.
- **Tool Type** → Category/classification (e.g., measuring device, cutting tool, calibration tool).

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Standardization** – Consistent tool data structure.
2. **Scalability** – Easily expandable as more tools are added.
3. **Integration** – Links with BOMs, work orders, and calibration schedules.
4. **Data Integrity** – Avoids duplication, ensuring reliable information.
