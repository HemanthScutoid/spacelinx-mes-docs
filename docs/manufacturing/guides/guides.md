# 📖 Guides Module – User Guide

A **Guide** is a documented instruction, reference, or work procedure that helps teams follow standardized processes in manufacturing, assembly, or maintenance.  
Guides ensure that **work is performed correctly, consistently, and safely**, while providing traceability for audits and process improvements.

### Why We Use Guides

- 📋 **Standardization:** Ensures all operators and engineers follow the same procedures.
- ✅ **Quality Assurance:** Reduces errors and maintains consistent output.
- 🕒 **Time-Saving:** Provides step-by-step instructions to perform tasks efficiently.
- 📑 **Documentation:** Maintains a record of processes for audits and compliance.
- 💡 **Training & Onboarding:** New employees can quickly learn procedures.

### When We Need Guides

- Creating **work instructions** for assembly or manufacturing tasks.
- Documenting **standard operating procedures (SOPs)**.
- Providing **part-specific reference materials** for engineers or operators.
- Updating procedures after **design or process changes**.
- Ensuring **regulatory or quality compliance** across teams.

The **Guides module** allows you to manage work instructions and reference guides linked to parts, platforms, and categories.  
From here, you can **view, create, update, and delete guides** that are part of the manufacturing process.
