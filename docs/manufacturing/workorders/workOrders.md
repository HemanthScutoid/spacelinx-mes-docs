# 📑 Work Orders

A **Work Order (WO)** is a formal document that specifies tasks, operations, or production activities to be performed in a manufacturing process.  
It provides a structured plan for production, linking parts, guides, and platforms, and ensures **traceability and accountability** throughout the manufacturing workflow.

### Why We Use Work Orders

- 📋 **Task Organization:** Clearly defines what needs to be done, by whom, and when.
- ✅ **Quality Assurance:** Ensures procedures are followed according to guides and standards.
- 🕒 **Production Tracking:** Helps track the status of work in real time (Pending → Assigned → In Progress → Completed).
- 📑 **Traceability:** Links production activities to parts, guides, and platforms for audits and reporting.
- 💡 **Resource Management:** Ensures materials, tools, and labor are available and allocated properly.

### When We Need Work Orders

- Planning and scheduling **manufacturing tasks**.
- Assigning **specific operations to teams or operators**.
- Tracking **progress of production** for individual parts or batches.
- Ensuring **compliance with standard procedures** and quality guidelines.
- Recording **start and completion dates** for accountability and reporting.

The **Work Orders page** allows you to view, create, and manage all manufacturing work orders.  
Each work order is linked to a platform, part, and guide, ensuring complete production traceability.
