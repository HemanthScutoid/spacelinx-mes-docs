# Material Kits

A **Material Kit** is a pre-packaged set of parts, tools, or components grouped together for a specific manufacturing task or work order.  
It ensures that all necessary materials are **available, confirmed, and traceable** before production starts.

### Why We Use Material Kits

- 📦 **Organization:** Groups all required parts for a work order in one kit.
- ✅ **Accuracy:** Reduces errors by providing the exact parts needed.
- 🕒 **Efficiency:** Speeds up production by avoiding delays searching for materials.
- 📑 **Traceability:** Links parts directly to work orders and manufacturing tasks.
- 💡 **Inventory Management:** Tracks kit quantities, location, and status in real-time.

### When We Need Material Kits

- Before starting a **work order**, to ensure all required parts are ready.
- When multiple parts or components must be **grouped together** for a task.
- To maintain **production traceability** and compliance with standards.
- For **efficient allocation of materials** to work orders in manufacturing.

The **Material Kits** page allows you to create, manage, and assign kits to work orders. Each kit represents a group of parts that can be confirmed, tracked, and linked to specific work orders.
