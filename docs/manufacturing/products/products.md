# 📦 Products Module – Overview

The **Products module** in SpaceLinx MES is designed to act as the **core hub for manufacturing execution**.  
A **Product** represents the **final deliverable** that connects:

- ✅ A **Part** (engineering definition)
- ✅ A **Guide** (instructions for manufacturing)
- ✅ A **Platform** (category/operational grouping)
- ✅ Its **Bill of Materials (BOM)**
- ✅ Its **Bill of Workorders (BoW)**

This ensures a **single, unified view** of everything required to manufacture and track a product.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Centralized Management**  
  Maintain a structured repository of all products manufactured in your organization.

- **Traceability**  
  Link every product to its underlying part, guide, workorders, and BOM.

- **Efficiency**  
  Provide quick navigation, search, and detailed product insights for planners and shop floor operators.

---

## 🔑 Core Concepts

- **Product Name** → The identity of the finished product.
- **Product Number / Sequence** → Unique reference used to order and track products.
- **Guide** → Manufacturing guide associated with the product.
- **Part** → The engineering part that forms the base of the product.
- **Platform** → Category or system under which the product belongs (e.g., Aerospace, Automotive).

## 🖥️ Features

### 1. **Product List & Navigation**

- Displays all products in a **scrollable carousel** format.
- Products can be searched using the **search bar**.
- Selecting a product highlights it and shows its details.

---

### 2. **Product Details**

For each selected product, the system shows:

- **Product Name & Number**
- **Guide Details** (with clickable link to the guide page)
- **Associated Part** (with option to open part details drawer)
- **Platform Information**
- **Quick Action: View Full Details**

---

### 3. **Bill of Workorders (BoW)**

- Lists all **workorders** associated with the selected product.
- Helps in understanding **production progress** and **execution flow**.

---

### 4. **Bill of Materials (BOM)**

- Displays the **structured breakdown of parts/components** required to manufacture the product.
- Enables **inventory checks** and ensures accurate procurement and assembly.

---

### 5. **Add New Product**

- Users with **Modify permission** can create new products.
- Clicking **+ Add new** opens a side drawer where product details can be entered.

---

### 6. **View & Edit Product Details**

- Users can open a **detailed drawer** to edit or update product information by clicking on **View Details** .
- Ensures products remain up-to-date with latest guide/part changes.

---

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Unified Visibility** – Connects engineering (Parts), planning (Guides), and execution (Workorders & BOM).
2. **Efficiency** – Quick navigation with search and scroll.
3. **Collaboration** – Different departments (Design, Production, Procurement) work on the same product definition.
4. **Traceability** – Every product is linked to its workorders and materials for full auditability.
