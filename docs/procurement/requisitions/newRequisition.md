# Create a New Requisition

## What is a Requisition?

A requisition is an internal request raised by employees when they need to purchase or obtain materials, parts, or services.  
This page allows you to **create a new requisition** by filling in details and adding required line items.

## Steps to Create a Requisition

### 1. Open the New Requisition Form

- Click on **+ Add New** from the Requisitions page.
- A side panel will open with two tabs:
  - **Details**
  - **Line Items**

---

### 2. Fill in Requisition Details (Tab 1: _Details_)

In this section, provide the overall requisition information:

- **Title** → A short name or subject for the requisition. _(Required)_
- **Requested By** → The person raising the requisition. _(Required)_
- **Expected Date** → The date when you need the requested items/services. _(Required)_
- **Priority** → Select urgency level (**Low, Medium, High**). _(Required)_
- **Project** → If the requisition is linked to a specific project, select it from the list.
- **Justification** → Explain why this requisition is needed (helps in approval).

👉 Click **Next** to proceed to the line items.

### 3. Add Line Items (Tab 2: _Line Items_)

Line items are the **actual parts or services** being requested.

For each item:

1. **Part** → Select the part number/name from the list. _(Required)_
   - If the part already exists in your list, you’ll get a warning.
2. **Quantity** → Enter how many units you need. _(Required)_
3. **Description** → Add extra details (optional).

Click **Add** to include it in the requisition.

- If you click on an existing row in the list, the details will appear in the input fields → allowing you to **edit and update**.
- You can also click **Cancel** if you decide not to update.

All added items appear in a **table below** with Part Number, Name, Quantity, and Description.

### 4. Save the Requisition

At the bottom of the panel, you will see:

- **Cancel** → Discards the requisition and closes the form.
- **Next** → Moves from _Details_ to _Line Items_.
- **Create** → Submits the requisition after adding line items.

Once submitted:

- ✅ A success message confirms the requisition is created.
- ❌ If something is missing, error messages will guide you to correct it.
