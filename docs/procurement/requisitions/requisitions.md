# Requisitions ‚Äì Requesting Materials or Services

## What is a Requisition?

A **requisition** is an internal request raised by employees when they need to purchase or obtain materials, parts, or services required for their work.  
It acts as the **first step in the purchasing process** ‚Äì before a Purchase Order (PO) is created.

- Employees raise a requisition when they need something.
- Managers or authorized users review and approve it.
- Once approved, the requisition can be converted into a **Purchase Order** for vendors.
